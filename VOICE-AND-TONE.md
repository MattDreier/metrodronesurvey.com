# Voice & Tone Guidelines: Metro Drone Survey

## The Challenge

Balance professional credibility with authentic, human connection. Desmond is a one-person operation serving his Kansas City community—not a faceless corporation.

## Who's Speaking?

**Desmond** - FAA-certified pilot, Kansas City local, takes pride in his craft and community

**To whom?** - Fellow Kansas City professionals (contractors, business owners) and homeowners. Real people in his community who need straight talk, not marketing-speak.

---

## Voice Characteristics

### ✅ DO Sound Like:
- **A skilled professional neighbor** - Someone you'd trust to help you out
- **Confident but humble** - "I know what they're looking for" not "We're the best in the industry"
- **Midwest straightforward** - No BS, no hype, just honest talk
- **Community-focused** - "Fellow Kansas City contractors" not "clients" or "customers"
- **Empathetic to pain points** - "You've been there..." acknowledges shared experiences
- **Pride in craft** - Takes work seriously, delivers quality
- **First-person authentic** - "I'll get you the data" or "We deliver" (both acceptable)

### ❌ DON'T Sound Like:
- Corporate marketing team
- Tech startup with buzzwords ("leverage," "synergy," "solutions")
- Over-the-top salesperson
- Impersonal service provider
- Arrogant expert talking down
- Generic national company

## Language Patterns

### Sentence Structure
- **Short, punchy sentences** - "Need it for tomorrow's meeting? I've got you."
- **Active voice** - "I'll document everything" not "Everything will be documented"
- **Conversational rhythm** - Like talking over coffee, not presenting a sales deck

### Word Choice
- **Industry language THEY use** - "Storm damage," "site survey," "pitch measurements"
- **Concrete over abstract** - "Roof condition reports" not "comprehensive documentation solutions"
- **Plain English** - "Fast" not "expedited," "accurate" not "precision-engineered"
- **Direct address** - "You," "your crew," "your business"

### Avoid These Phrases:
- "World-class," "best-in-class," "industry-leading"
- "Leverage," "synergy," "utilize," "facilitate"
- "Solutions," "value proposition," "ecosystem"
- "Unparalleled," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge"
- Anything that sounds like it came from a corporate brochure

## Tone Variations by Section

### Hero Section
**Tone:** Welcoming, direct, empathetic
**Goal:** Make them feel understood immediately

**Example:**
"You make tough calls every day. Roof condition? Shading issues? Storm damage? Get the aerial data you need in 24 hours—without putting your crew on a sketchy roof."

### Features/Why Choose Us
**Tone:** Confident, helpful, safety-focused
**Goal:** Build trust through expertise and shared values

**Example:**
"Why send someone onto a damaged roof when a drone can do it safer? Every flight is FAA Part 107 certified with $2M liability coverage—but more importantly, your team stays on the ground."

### Services
**Tone:** Practical, knowledgeable, empathetic to industry pain points
**Goal:** Show you understand their specific challenges

**Example:**
"You know the drill: solar financiers want roof condition reports, shading analysis, accurate pitch measurements. Miss one detail and you're back to square one. I'll document everything they're looking for and get it to you in 24 hours."

### Testimonials
**Tone:** Genuine, transformation-focused
**Goal:** Let other Kansas City pros vouch for the work

**Keep existing testimonials** - They're already authentic. Just add brief context about the transformation.

### Call-to-Action
**Tone:** Friendly, low-pressure, action-oriented
**Goal:** Make it easy to take the next step

**Example:**
"Ready to see the whole picture? Call me at (816) 719-2540 or shoot me an email. Most quotes back to you within 2 hours."

## The "Coffee Shop Test"

**Before finalizing any copy, ask:**
- Would Desmond actually say this to a fellow contractor over coffee at a Kansas City coffee shop?
- Does it sound like a real person talking, or a marketing department?
- Would a Kansas City business owner read this and think "This guy gets it"?

If the answer is "no" to any of these, rewrite it.
